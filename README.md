# Weolcome to this React test project

This project was made by Eduardo Oviedo and took arround 9 hours.

## To run the project

First clone the repo.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# Completition

## It works!

The project is almost complete. It's missing the summary and submit screens.
Can be done with more time.

## Clean and clear

The project was made with TypeScript and a lot of best practices are included.
Please check the **types.ts** files.

## Organization

The project is organized by components, and each component with his **Async** and **State** folders.
You will find a Store and Types folder in the root, those are for general purpose, but each component comes with his own **actions.ts** **reducers.ts** and **types.ts** files.

## Planning

Started the project by making questions, drawing ideas and exploring options with the technologies.
Decided to start with the UI, then moving to Redux to finally spend some time improving functionalties.
I estimate at least 4 hours more to finish.

## Data, state and events management

The project is using Redux as it should.
The data is being moved respecting the inmutability rules and best practices.

Created multiple stores and the reducers handle all events.

**_Important:_** The data is persistent: Input some data, then reload the Web Browser, the data remains.

## Look

It looks great.
I decided to experiment with neumorphism to show my habilities with design and styling.
